# CMSC 14100 Practice Problems

A collection of hand-written practice problems from yours truly <3.

How to use this repository:

1. Try being a computer in [evaluate.py](/evaluate.py)
2. Test your knowledge of arrays in [arrays.py](/arrays.py)
3. Polish up your dictionary skills in [dictionaries.py](/dictionaries.py)

When you want to check your answers, read through the explanations in the relevant `_solutions.py` file.

It is possible some example implementations are not perfect. They are meant to represent a common or obvious way of completing the problem, which would most likely pass you well on a test.

You can test your solutions by running (though this may be too strict)
```
pytest -v
```

You should also look over the test answers that are printed by un-commenting the short tests that are included in the `_solutions.py` files.
